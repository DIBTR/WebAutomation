## Project Structure
This section provides an overview of the organization and structure of the project. 

`src/`: Main source code directory.

+ `pages/`: Contains page classes representing different pages of the application. Each page class encapsulates the actions and elements related to a specific page.

+ `helpers/`: Includes helper classes providing reusable functions for automation. Examples include interacting with the browser or handling common tasks.

+ `utils/`: Contains utility classes with general-purpose functions that can be used across the project.

+ `data/`: Holds data-related files, including test data and the Redux store for holding test-related data.

+ `specs/`: Houses spec files containing actual test scenarios. Each spec file typically corresponds to a specific feature or functionality.

+ `index.ts`: Acts as the entry point for the TypeScript project, where you might configure and initialize your test environment.

+ `config/`
  * playwright.config.js: Playwright configuration file specifying settings for testing.

  * tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration file defining compiler options for the TypeScript project.

## Configuration
This framework provides flexibility in test execution platform selection, offering three main options: Localhost, BrowserStack, SeleniumGrid

#### Localhost Execution 
Project is configured to run it on Localhost by default.

#### Browserstack Execution
For remote execution on the BrowserStack platform, need to pass `RUN_ON_BROWSERSTACK` parameter through command line. 
````bash
 RUN_ON_BROWSERSTACK=true npx playwright test << spec file name >>
 Replace <<spec-file>> with the actual path to your test spec file.
 ````

#### SeleniumGrid Execution 
For remote execution on the Selenium grid platform, need to pass `SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL` parameter through command line.
````bash
SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL=http://localhost:4444 npx playwright test <<spec-file>>
Replace <<spec-file>> with the actual path to your test spec file.
````

#### Playwright HTML Report
+ This report template is bydefault `ON` in the project. If user wish to turn off then need to disable in reporter object in playwright config file. 
    `['html', { outputFolder: `playwright-report/${REPORT_TYPE}`, open: 'never' }]` reporter in `playwright.config -> Reporter`.
  

#### Reportportal 
+ For Reportportal result logging need to pass `LOG_RESULT_TO_REPORT_PORTAL` parameter through command line.
````bash
LOG_RESULT_TO_REPORT_PORTAL=true npx playwright test <<spec-file>>
Replace <<spec-file>> with the actual path to your test spec file.
````


## Execution Platform Support

### Browserstack Integration 
To run this project on browserstack platform, user need to pass `RUN_ON_BROWSERSTACK` parameter through command line.

Setup selenium grid with the help of docker. Below is command to run selenium grid in docker. Use any one command from below as per machine architecture.

    `docker run -d -p 4444:4444 --shm-size="2g" -e SE_NODE_GRID_URL="http://localhost:4444" selenium/standalone-chrome:4.3.0-20220726`

Alternatively for arm architecture

    `docker run -d -p 4444:4444 --shm-size="2g" -e SE_NODE_GRID_URL="http://localhost:4444" seleniarm/standalone-chromium:103.0`

**Verifying Selenium Grid Environment :**

After successfully executing the following command, check [http://localhost:4444/ui](http://localhost:4444/ui). If the Selenium Grid environment is up, you are ready to run the tests.

**Command to run test on Selenium Grid :**
````bash
  SELENIUM_REMOTE_URL=http://localhost:4444 npx playwright test <<spec-file>>
  Replace <<spec-file>> with the actual path to your test spec file.
````

## Automation Testing Support
Our project offers comprehensive testing capabilities, providing automation support for various types of testing:

### Functional Testing 
To write end2end functional automated test we are using playwright, below is the command to run functional test using npm.

````bash
npx playwright test <<spec file >>
Replace <<spec-file>> with the actual path to your test spec file.
````

### Visual Testing
This project provides robust support for visual automation testing, allowing you to efficiently validate the visual appearance of your web application across different states and screen resolutions.

**Pre-requisite :**
+ Applitools Account: Before you start, you need to sign up for an Applitools account. You can create an account on the Applitools website.
Applitools API Key:

+ Once you have an Applitools account, you need to obtain an API key. The API key is used for authentication when running visual tests. You can find your API key in the Applitools dashboard.

### Applitools Integration
Before running the visual test, set up your API key as an environment variable named APPLITOOLS_API_KEY. You may set it through your IDE (if applicable), or you may set it from the command line like this:
    `export APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<your-api-key>`

**Analysis Test Result on Applitools**

### Accessibility Testing
This sectiion incorporates accessibility testing to ensure that the web application is usable and accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. The Axe library is used to automate accessibility testing and identify potential issues.

[Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) is an open-source JavaScript library for automated accessibility testing.By default, axe checks against a wide variety of accessibility rules. Some of these rules correspond to specific success criteria from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and others are "best practice" rules that are not specifically required by any WCAG criterion.

A few examples of problems this can catch include:

+ Text that would be hard to read for users with vision impairments due to poor color contrast with the background behind it
+ UI controls and form elements without labels that a screen reader could identify
+ Interactive elements with duplicate IDs which can confuse assistive technologies

**How to run Accissiblity Test :**
* Command to execute accissiblity test `npx playwright test << spec file >>`.
* Example : `npx playwright test accessibility.run.home.page.spec.ts`

**Exporting accessibility scan results as a test attachment:**

+ Upon completion of the accessibility test run, an HTML report will be generated with embedded attachments for any accessibility violations identified.

## Test Management Support
### Zephyr Integration
This section provides information on how to integrate Playwright with Zephyr for Jira to log test results after each test execution.
Integrating Playwright with Zephyr for Jira allows us to log test results directly into our test management system. This helps in maintaining a centralized repository of test execution status, enabling better traceability and reporting.

+ Generate an API token in Zephyr for authentication.[Refer to Zephyr's documentation](https://support.smartbear.com/zephyr-scale-cloud/docs/en/rest-api/generating-api-access-tokens.html) to know how to create API token.
+ In ZReporter.ts file update the `Authorization: Bearer << authentication token goes here >>` with token value which retrived in above step.
